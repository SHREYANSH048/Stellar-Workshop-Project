# Remote Learning Classrooms App

## Project Description
A smart contract built using Soroban SDK that allows remote classrooms to be scheduled, tracked, and concluded efficiently. This is a simplified blockchain-based backend for managing class sessions securely and transparently.

## Project Vision
To provide a decentralized, immutable system that ensures the integrity and accountability of remote education sessions. This contract can serve as a foundation for educational platforms leveraging blockchain for record-keeping.

## Key Features
- *Create Session*: Instructors can create new class sessions with topics and timestamps.
- *End Session*: Sessions can be marked as concluded to track attendance or enforce time limits.
- *Query Session Info*: Anyone can retrieve session details using a unique session ID.

## Future Scope
- Add role-based access control for instructors and students.
- Integrate attendance logging for participants.
- Enable certificate issuance for completed sessions.
- Link with IPFS or decentralized storage for storing session recordings or resources.
